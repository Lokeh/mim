# mim

A powerful task runner, built for clojure.

## Installation

For now, clone this repo and run `./install.sh`

## Usage

Once you've gone through the installation steps, you may run `mim` from a
terminal to see usage instructions.

The basic idea is that, in your project (or wherever) you create a `mim.edn`
file. This file should be a map of keys and values that you can use to reference
through the CLI tool.

Example 1:

```clojure
{:foo {:bar "baz"}}
```

Now when you run `mim foo bar` in the same directory as this file, the app:

0. (Optional) Starts the mim server
1. Loads the `mim.edn` file
2. Obtains value contained at the path passed to the `mim` command
3. Evaluates the value as a Clojure form

In this case, the app evalutes "baz" and simply exits, without outputting
anything.

```
$ mim foo bar
:mim/exit 0
```

If we want to output something, we simply print to `*out*`:

```clojure
{:foo {:bar (println "baz)"}}
```

```
$ mim foo bar
baz
:mim/exit 0
```

Now, let's do something kind of useful. Mim comes built in with a `mim/task`
function that allows us to easily run commands from the shell:

```clojure
{:home (mim/task "ls ~")}
```

```
$ mim home
:mim/exit 0
emacs-mac       lilactown       mim
clojure         js       
```
